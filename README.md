## Description
This project is a React application that allows the user to view an entire employee directory at once so that they have quick access to relevant information and data. 

The code for the application's UI is broken into components. The UI components are responsive to user events via sort and filter functionality, as well as managing the component’s state independently. Finally, this project was bootstrapped with Create React App.
